  Scout matches available players to local teams needing subs. Managers will never have to play another game short-handed and players will find games convenient to their schedule and location.
  
  Scout matches recreational sports teams to other players looking to join games. When opening the app, it will immediately bring to the front page. The front page consists multiple players applying for several games and/or pick up.  On the top right is a link to a different page which is the filter page.
  
    In the filter page the user can check/uncheck boxes that changes the distance one is willing to travel, the sports games they are looking for, which league, and even the skill level.
    
    The user can also, as a player can apply for games, where managers can ask players, start/host games, and accept player applications.
    
    After each game, both the player and user are suggested to put in a review. In the review there are 2 rating systems. Both are a 1 - 5 star rating system. Ettiquette is a rating system based off of the player/managers behavior, with 1 being extremly toxic, and 5 being an amazing. The second rating system is skill level, where 1 is not skilled enough, 3 average player, and 5 being too skilled.
